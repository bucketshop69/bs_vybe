# Vybe Telegram Bot (bs_vybe)

## üöÄ Overview

This Telegram bot provides real-time insights and alerts based on data from the Vybe API, focusing on Solana Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and token price movements. It allows users to track top traders, monitor their wallets, and set custom price alerts for specific tokens.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **KOL Tracking:** View ranked lists of top KOL traders, see their performance metrics (PnL, win rate, volume), view detailed profiles, and track their wallets for trade alerts. Includes periodic updates on ranking changes.
*   **Token Price Alerts:**
    *   Track specific tokens (by symbol or address) for significant price movement alerts.
    *   Set custom price targets (above or below current price) for specific tokens.
    *   View and manage active alerts.
*   **Wallet Tracking:** Track specific Solana wallet addresses (initially focused on KOL wallets, but potentially extensible).
*   **Interactive Interface:** Uses Telegram commands and inline keyboards for navigation (e.g., pagination for KOL lists).
*   **Real-time Data:** Leverages the Vybe API for up-to-date KOL and token information.
*   **Notifications:** Sends alerts directly to users via Telegram for tracked events (price movements, KOL trades, KOL ranking changes).
*   **Image Generation:** Can generate images (e.g., price boards - currently via `/prices`).

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

*   **`src/telegram.ts`:** Main bot logic, handles commands, user interactions, message formatting, and integration with other modules.
*   **`src/vybeApi.ts`:** Interacts with the external Vybe API to fetch KOL and token data.
*   **`src/database.ts`:** Manages database interactions for storing user subscriptions, tracked wallets, alerts, etc. (Specific implementation details depend on the database used).
*   **`src/tokenPriceService.ts`:** Handles fetching and potentially caching token price information.
*   **`src/tokenAlerts.ts`:** Logic for checking and triggering price alerts.
*   **`src/utils/imageGenerator.ts`:** Utility for creating image-based outputs (like price boards).
*   **`.env`:** Stores sensitive configuration like API keys and bot tokens.

## TODO / Future Enhancements

*   Refine wallet tracking beyond KOLs.
*   Expand alert types (e.g., volume changes, new token listings).
*   Add more data visualizations.
*   Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   Consider user configuration options (e.g., alert thresholds).
